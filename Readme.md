# DSGN 270 Assignment 5 - Figma Prototype

#### Jibril Adem

# Process

- I began this assignment by utilising a mockup page from a prior project.

- I designed a prototype navigation to the `Shop all` page from the navbar.

- The homepage may also be accessed from the `Shop all` page by clicking on the business logo in the navbar.

- Then, from the navbar on the `Homepage` select `Shoecare` to get to the `Shoecare` page.
